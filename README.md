# Telegram-Data-Collection
Description
The Telegram-Data-Collection is a method that collects data from Telegram . Given a Telegram channel(or a list of channels) as an input, it generates a collection of all messages from the channels. The framework uses Telethon API in the backend that interacts with the Telegram application to fetch messages from the channels.An user can leverage this tool to extract relevant messages from Telegram channels tailored to their specific interests.

Social Science Usecase
John is a researcher studying about misinformation and rumors in social media. He seeks to harness Telegram data for his research endeavors. He visits the MH portal to find this method that helps him to fetch data from Telegram channels. He uses the search box on the top of the interface and types in Data Collection or Telegram. The search functionality of the MH shows him a list or related methods and tutorials that provides John with methods that can help him generate this huge collection of messages which he can reuse for his study.
