# Telegram-Data-Collection

## Description

The method extracts messages broadcast across Telegram channels. As a broadcasting social media platform, on Telegram channel administrator can broadcast their content as text or other media messages to disseminate information to the users of that channel. This method takes public channel IDs (as seeds), requires a telephone number with Telegram App, and extracts messages in JSON format across all seed channels as well as other public channels where the messages from the seed channels were forwarded. 

## Use Cases

Telegram data, such as collected via this method, can be used in various analyses. For example:

- Analysing extremism in a specific geographic area (e.g., Walther, Samantha, and Andrew McCoy. "US extremism on Telegram." Perspectives on Terrorism 15.2 (2021): 100-124.)
- Analysing terrorism and mass media (e.g., Yayla, Ahmet S., and Anne Speckhard. "Telegram: The mighty application that ISIS loves." International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism 9 (2017).)
- Analysing right wing networks (e.g., Urman, Aleksandra, and Stefan Katz. "What they do in the shadows: examining the far-right networks on Telegram." Information, communication & society 25.7 (2022): 904-923.)
- Analysing social media and fake channels (e.g., La Morgia, Massimo, et al. "Itâ€™s a Trap! Detection and Analysis of Fake Channels on Telegram." 2023 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS). IEEE, 2023.)

## Input data

The input of this method is channel names which needs to be specified in a [seed list](input/public_group_seed_list.txt) file, one channel name per line. For example:

```
britishnewspatriot
bloomberg
SpotifyGroup
```

## Output Data

The method writes the collected raw data as JSON objects containing the messages and their metadata into one file per channel. the [`output/messages`](output/messages/) directory. The method keeps track of the last collected messages per channel, so that those are not fetched again when the method is run again. An example message is shown here, whereas others are in [`examples/bloomberg.txt`](examples/bloomberg.txt):

## Hardware Requirements

The method runs on a small virtual machine provided by a cloud computing company (2 x86 CPU core, 4 GB RAM, 40GB HDD). However, more resources are needed to set it up for large-scale Telegram data collection.

## Environment Setup

This method requires Python 3.10 or higher to run. To avoid problems with your system's Python installation, create and activate a virtual environment (e.g., [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

Then install all requirements using:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to have Telegram installed and a Telegram account in your phone

## How to Use

1. Run in command line:
  ```bash
  python extract_from_seed_list.py
  ```
2. The framework will ask for a phone number: Enter the phone number through which Telegram account has been created
3. The framework will ask for an one time password: Enter the one-time-password (OTP) sent to you through the Telegram app

By default, this will collect 10 messages for each channel. Change this number using the `MAX_MESSAGES` settings in the [`config.py`](config.py). You can also modify the input and output files there.

Your authentication information is stored in a `nano.session` file, so that you do not need to re-authenticate on next use. Do not share this file.
