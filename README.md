# Telegram-Data-Collection
# Description
The method helps to deploy a Telegram data collection setup for extracting Telegram messages broadcast across channels. As a broadcasting social media platform, the channel administrator can broadcast content as text messages and other media to disseminate information to the users of that channel. The method takes public channel IDs (as seeds) and a telephone number with Telegram App installed as input and extracts messages across all seed channels as well as other public channels where the message was published. 

# Relevant research questions that could be adressed with the help of this method

1. Study of extremism in a specific geographic area(Walther, Samantha, and Andrew McCoy. "US extremism on Telegram." Perspectives on Terrorism 15.2 (2021): 100-124.)

2. Study of Terrorism and Mass Media (Yayla, Ahmet S., and Anne Speckhard. "Telegram: The mighty application that ISIS loves." International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism 9 (2017).)

3. Right wing networks and their analysis (Urman, Aleksandra, and Stefan Katz. "What they do in the shadows: examining the far-right networks on Telegram." Information, communication & society 25.7 (2022): 904-923.)

4. Investigate social media and fake channels (La Morgia, Massimo, et al. "Itâ€™sa Trap! Detection and Analysis of Fake Channels on Telegram." 2023 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS). IEEE, 2023.)


# Social Science Usecase
John is a researcher studying about misinformation and rumors in social media. He seeks to harness Telegram data for his research endeavors. He visits the MH portal to find this method that helps him to fetch data from Telegram channels. He uses the search box on the top of the interface and types in Data Collection or Telegram. The search functionality of the MH shows him a list or related methods and tutorials that provides John with methods that can help him generate this huge collection of messages which he can reuse for his study.


# Keywords
Telegram, Social-Media, Data Collection

# Repo Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
* Folders
  
    `public_group_messages folder` -output folder where messages from channels will be stored as txt files

    `seed folder` - input folder where the channel names from where messages should be collected is stored

    `src folder` - Main code for data collection using Telethon API

    `tracking folder` - output folder for tracking the channel names and the time of the last message collected

* Files

    `config.py` - configurable parameters of the framework

# Environment SetUp
This method requires Python 3.x to run.

# Dependencies
To install the dependencies you may use: 

  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt `

You should also have Telegram installed and a Telegram account in your phone


# Limitation
The method collects only the raw messages. For enrichments to the messages, further modifications to the code would be required

# How to Use

Run in command line:    python 1_extract_from_seed_list.py

The framework will ask for a phone number : Enter the phone number through which Telegram account has been created

The framework will ask for an one time password : Enter the OTP sent to you through the Telegram app




# Input data
The output of this method is channel names which needs to be specified in the public_group_seed_list.txt file in seed folder
